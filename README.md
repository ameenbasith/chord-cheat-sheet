# The Problem
The idea for this application was born after a friend had requested if I could make him an app that would assist in improving his music production skills. 

After intently listening to his beats that he made, I found that a very significant issue with his music is the fact that he just used random chords and placed them next to one another, therefore, they sounded fairly unprofessional.

# The Solution
Therefore, I had to determine the best course of action, which was to create an app that ALREADY outlines the chords, but provides a method to actually learn how to string these chords together. I then started brain storming the overall design, and came up with the idea of including a form that outputs the "feel" for each key selected and also the chords that work in the given key. 

Here is a short demonstration explaining the process and how the chord sheet works! (time stamps below)

0:25 (Chord buttons make sound!)
0:48 (Cycling through Keys/Vibes)
1:25 (Choosing my own chords!)
2:08 (Live Demo)
2:25 (Final Thoughts)
3:05 (Switching Theme Animation from Dark to Light mode)

# Final Thoughts
Ultimately, I am incredibly happy with how this application turned out, and, as mentioned in the above video, there are currently 3 people utilizing the application to assist in improving their own beats. Honestly, I have a lot of ideas to improve this application in the future, including the possibility of actually recording the chord progressions, and even being able to download the final .MIDI file.
